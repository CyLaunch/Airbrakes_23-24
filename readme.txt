# CyLaunch Airbrakes 2024

This repository contains all related code for the 2023-2024 Airbrakes for NASA Student Launch.

## Airbrakes 2024
The goal of the 2024 airbrakes was to ensure the rocket would hit a specific altitude (Set at 5000ft this year), exactly on the dot. It does this by calculating the predicited apogee based on the current speed, and then deploying air brakes for a specific interval of time to slow the rocket down till its predicited to hit the wanted apogee.


## Hardware used
A Raspberry Pi Zero was used along with a barometer and servo motor from adafruit.
