# CyLaunch Airbrakes 2024

This repository contains all software developed for the airbrake subsystem. This software was made open to the public at the conclusion of the 2023-24 NASA University Student Launch Initative compeition season. 

## Software Purpose
The goal of the 2024 airbrake subsystem was to reduce the apogee to more accurately hit the target altitude (Set at 5000ft this year). It does this by calculating the predicited apogee based on the current speed, and then deploying air brakes for a specific interval of time to slow the rocket down till its predicited to hit the wanted apogee.


## Hardware used
* Raspberry Pi Zero 2W
* Adafruit BMP 390 Barometer
* Adafruit ICM-ICM-20948
